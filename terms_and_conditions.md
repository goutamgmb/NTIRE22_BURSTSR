# Burst Image Super-Resolution Challenge
These are the official rules (terms and conditions) that govern how the 
NTIRE 2022 challenge on Burst Image Super-Resolution will operate. This challenge will 
be simply referred to as the "challenge" or the "contest" throughout the remaining part 
of these rules and may be named as "NTIRE" or "BurstSR" benchmark, challenge, or 
contest, elsewhere (our webpage, our documentation, other publications).

In these rules, "we", "our", and "us" refer to the organizers 
(Goutam Bhat (goutam.bhat [at] vision.ee.ethz.ch), Martin Danelljan (martin.danelljan [at] vision.ee.ethz.ch) 
and Radu Timofte (Radu.Timofte [at] vision.ee.ethz.ch)) of NTIRE challenge and "you" and "yourself" 
refer to an eligible contest participant.

Note that these official rules can change during the contest until the start of the 
final phase. If at any point during the contest the registered participant considers 
that can not anymore meet the eligibility criteria or does not agree with the changes 
in the official terms and conditions then it is the responsibility of the participant 
to send an email to the organizers such that to be removed from all the records. 
Once the contest is over no change is possible in the status of the registered 
participants and their entries.

## 1. Contest description
This is a skill-based contest and chance plays no part in the determination of the 
winner (s).

The goal of the contest is to restore the image contents from a set of burst input 
images and the challenge is called Burst Image Super-Resolution.

Focus of the contest: it will be made available a dataset adapted for the specific 
needs of the challenge. The images have a large diversity of contents. 
We will refer to this dataset, its partition, and related materials as BurstSR Dataset. 
The dataset is divided into training, validation and testing data. We focus on the 
quality of the results, the aim is to achieve output images with the best fidelity, as 
computed via PSNR or a user study. 
and similar to the reference clean ground truth. The participants will not have 
access to the ground truth images from the test data. 
The ranking of the participants is according to the performance of their methods on 
the test data. The participants will provide descriptions of their methods, 
details on (run)time complexity, platform and (extra) data used for modeling. 
The winners will be determined according to their entries, the reproducibility of 
the results and uploaded codes or executables, and the above mentioned criteria as 
judged by the organizers.

## 2. Tentative contest schedule
The registered participants will be notified by email if any changes are made to the 
schedule. The schedule is available on the [NTIRE workshop web page](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire22/) 
and on the 
official GitHub [repository]().
